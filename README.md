# BlueQueue

Created by Gisselle Estevez & Eli Blaney as a final project for CSC 551 (Web Programming) at Creighton University.

## Description

In an effort to elucidate online procedures during a pandemic, we created this project to streamline the process of reserving time slots at Creighton University's Kiewit Fitness Center (KFC). This web project allows for a simple interface for students to create an appointment as well as to learn more about Creighton's services and policies.
